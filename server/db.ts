	/**
	 * Carry a character's changed opening into the chats that are still nothing but that
	 * opening.
	 *
	 * A chat nobody has written in is a **mirror** of the card, not a copy of it: its rows
	 * hold the First Message and the alternate greetings and nothing else, so an edit to the
	 * card has to reach them or every unstarted chat quietly opens on a version of the
	 * character that no longer exists. The moment the chat holds something the user put
	 * there (a turn, a reply, a hand-edited greeting, an extra opening written by hand), it
	 * is a story, and the card stops reaching it.
	 *
	 * There is deliberately **no "this chat has been used" flag**. A chat qualifies by what it
	 * holds right now: exactly the greetings the card handed it (`chats.seeded_greetings`),
	 * every row still an unedited root-level assistant turn. That is what makes
	 * the rewrite safe (a single character the user typed anywhere in the chat breaks the
	 * match), and it is why a chat emptied back down to its greetings follows the card again:
	 * nothing left in it is the user's to protect, and "has this been used" is a question about
	 * the past rather than about what the chat holds.
	 *
	 * **Recognition asks the CHAT, never the card's history**, and that is the load-bearing
	 * half. Matching against the greetings a save happens to be replacing looks equivalent and
	 * is not: a chat holding a story while the card moves on ends up holding a text the card no
	 * longer recognises, so emptying it back out could never hand it back. What that produced
	 * is worse than either answer: the chat followed the card or not depending on invisible
	 * history, which from outside reads as random.
	 *
	 * Scope is the variant that actually changed. Chats pinned elsewhere keep what they were
	 * pinned to, and a save that MOVES the active pointer (a fork, a version switch) is not a
	 * content edit at all, so it reconciles nothing.
