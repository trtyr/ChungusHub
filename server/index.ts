// ===== WebSocket message handling (sync + LLM streaming) =====

/**
 * A reply and an opening scene are written HERE, because the page that asked for them may
 * never come back: a phone whose browser is discarded loses the request id with the tab, and
 * the reply it paid for would sit unclaimed until its window ran out. Every other call keeps
 * its result client-side, and the difference is what the loss costs. Chat memory refires on
 * the next turn, a sprite is re-read, a spellcheck is a button press, and a continue extends
 * a turn that is already safe on disk and re-continues with one click. None of those is a
 * story the reader cannot get back, and giving each of them a commit path would be machinery
 * that only ever runs where nothing was at stake.
 *
 * The placement shape itself is in shared/generation.ts, since both ends speak it.
 *
 * This writes a finished generation's reply into the story and tells every device, in that
 * order, so a page reading the `messages` hint finds committed state rather than racing it.
 *
 * Returns the new turn's id and the steering notes it really spent, for the `llm-done` frame,
 * or null when there was nothing to land: a stop that kept no text (the reader asked for
 * nothing to be kept), or a chat that was deleted while the model was writing.
 *
 * The broadcast deliberately carries no origin, unlike an ordinary mutation's: the page that
 * started this may be gone, and the one that is still here needs the hint as much as the
 * others. Its own copy defers safely behind `missedSyncWhileStreaming` while it is streaming
 * (architecture/chat-sessions.md).
