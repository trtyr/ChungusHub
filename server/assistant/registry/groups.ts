/**
 * Capability groups: the families the assistant's tools belong to.
 *
 * One table, three consumers, and that is the whole point: the system prompt's tool index
 * is generated from it (so a new capability owes the prompt nothing but its name in a
 * family line), the user's Capabilities setting switches whole families on and off against
 * it, and `src/lib/contracts.test.ts` asserts the table still partitions `CAPABILITIES`
 * exactly: every tool in one family, no family naming a tool that no longer exists.
 *
 * The prompt block this replaces was 1.7k tokens of prose restating the very tool schemas
 * that sit beside it in the same cached prefix. Moving a sentence between the two costs
 * nothing and gains nothing; the only thing the schemas genuinely cannot supply is the
 * grouping itself, which is what lives here.
