/**
 * What bounds a completion, against real sockets.
 *
 * The distinction these tests exist to pin: the idle timeout is a LIVENESS check and the
 * headers deadline is not. A generating model emits continuously, so silence between chunks
 * really does mean nothing is coming, however long the whole generation runs. Before the
 * first byte there is no such signal, so the only honest bounds left are the user's Stop and
 * a backstop far past anything worth waiting through. Getting that backwards is what made a
 * healthy slow generation on local hardware fail as if the endpoint were dead.
