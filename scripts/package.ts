Run ${exeName}. A browser opens at http://localhost:${DEFAULT_PORT} and that is the app.
Keep this folder together. Your stories, characters and settings live in the
user-data folder created next to the executable. Keep it out of OneDrive,
Dropbox and any other synced folder: a sync client copying the database while
the app is writing to it can corrupt it.

ChungusHub backs that folder up on its own, into a backups folder beside it,
and always takes one before it upgrades its own database. Settings → Backups
is where you change how often, and where you go back to an earlier one. Both
folders hold your stories and your API keys, so copy them somewhere safe and
treat that copy the way you treat this one.

The port and both folder locations live in chungushub.config.json, written
beside the executable the first time you run it. Change "port" there if
something else on this machine already answers on ${DEFAULT_PORT}, or point
"dataDir" at a folder of your own to keep one workspace while the app itself
is replaced or moved. Set "openBrowser" to false and it serves without
opening one, which is what a machine you are not sitting at wants. If you
reach the app by a name rather than an address, a Tailscale name or your own
domain, put that name in "allowedHostnames", the name alone with no port;
its own address, localhost and this computer's name always work and need
nothing there. Changes apply the next time ChungusHub starts.
${firstLaunch}
To reach the app from your phone or another computer:

  1. On this machine, open Settings → Security and turn on Network Access.
     While it is off, the app runs for this computer alone and there is
     nothing on your network to connect to.

  2. On the other device, go to http://<this-machine's-ip>:${DEFAULT_PORT}
     It lands on a page saying it is not allowed yet. Leave it open.

  3. Back in Settings → Security, that device is now waiting under
     Device Access. Press Allow and it walks straight in.

Password Lock sits below Device Access and asks your other devices for a
password before they can use the app. This computer is never asked.

If this machine has no screen, the switches and the device list live in
files beside the executable. Run ChungusHub once, then edit them in any
text editor. Both apply straight away, with no restart.

    user-data/security.json    set "networkAccessEnabled" to true
    user-data/allowlist.json   add your computer: ["192.168.1.20"]

If you do not know your computer's address, save the first file only and
open http://<this-machine's-ip>:${DEFAULT_PORT} from it. The page you land on names
the address you arrived from and retries on its own, so putting that
address in the second file is all it takes to walk in.
