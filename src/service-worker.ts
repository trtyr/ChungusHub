/**
 * Minimal app-shell service worker: it makes the PWA installable and lets the
 * static assets load offline. API/WS/file requests always go to the network;
 * those are live data and must never be served stale.
 *
 * The bundled ambient recordings are the one exception under `/files/`, and they
 * are the exception because they are not the reader's data: they ship with the
 * build and cannot change under their own name while it is running. Treated as
 * live, a mix re-downloads megabytes on every play for nothing. A service worker
 * exists only in a secure context, so a phone opening the app over plain HTTP on
 * the LAN never has this one and relies on the route's own cache-control.

 * recording is then silent for good. So the status and the type are both
