/**
 * Svelte action: mount rendered HTML into an element and keep every node that did not
 * change.
 *
 * Usage: <div class="prose" use:renderedHtml={html}></div>
 *
 * The transcript paints model output as a string of HTML, and `{@html}` applies one by
 * throwing the whole subtree away and building a fresh one. That is invisible for a settled
 * turn and ruinous for a streaming one, because a reply arrives dozens of times a second
 * and everything the reader is doing inside that subtree lives on the nodes it destroys:
 *
 *   - A folding panel loses the `open` the reader just clicked, so it snaps shut a frame later.
 *   - Worse, the click usually never lands at all. A click fires on the common ancestor of
 *     where the press went down and where it came up, so a panel replaced between the two
 *     hands the event to the container instead and the panel never hears it.
 *   - A text selection collapses the moment the next chunk arrives.
 *
 * So the new HTML is parsed into an inert `<template>` and reconciled against what is on
 * screen: matching nodes are kept and patched, the rest is replaced. Streaming is
 * append-only in practice, which is the case this is best at: the tail grows and
 * everything above it is left alone, still holding its state and still able to take a click.
 *
 * The HTML is trusted to be sanitized already (`utils/markdown.ts` is the only source);
 * nothing here relaxes that, and `<template>` is inert, so nothing in the string can run
 * while it is being parsed.
 */

/** One parser for the app, made on first use. Reused rather than created per patch, and
 *  emptied after each one so a discarded subtree isn't held alive by it. Lazy because a
 *  module-level `document` would run at import time, and this module has no business
 *  deciding whether it is being imported somewhere without one. */
