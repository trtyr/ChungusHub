/**
 * The transient channel of the app's notification contract, and the queue behind the toast
 * stack. The contract itself is four channels, picked by one question: does the reader have
 * to do something about it?
 *
 *   nothing   The screen already says it. A row that vanished, a star that lit, an editor that
 *             closed. This is the DEFAULT answer, and the reason most acts notify nothing at
 *             all: a line repeating what is already on screen only teaches the eye to skip the
 *             corner where the failures land.
 *   toast     Something happened the screen does NOT show, and no answer is needed. A count the
 *             reader cannot see, work that landed off-screen, a consequence somewhere else.
 *   in place  A failure belongs where the act was: the dialog that raised it, the field that
 *             refused it. That is `ui/Alert.svelte`, never this queue: a toast fired from
 *             inside a dialog is a message the reader cannot reach.
 *   standing  A condition rather than an event (no connection, work not on disk). It lasts as
 *             long as it is true, so it can never be a toast, which leaves while it still is.
 *
 * Wording, so 100+ call sites read as one voice:
 *   - `failed(act, cause)` is the ONLY door a thrown error takes to the screen. The thrown text
 *     names a symptom ("429 rate_limit_exceeded"); only the call site knows which of the
 *     reader's clicks produced it, and a reason without its act is unusable.
 *   - `error(message)` is for a sentence you wrote yourself: a validation, a refusal.
 *   - Name things in quotes, state real counts, never "some" or "a few".
 *   - No em dash, ever. Two clauses are two sentences, or a colon.
 *   - One sentence carries no trailing period; two or more keep theirs.
 *   - Durations are a property of the tone, not of the sentence, so they are not a parameter.
 *   - A toast carries no buttons. Anything that needs an answer is asked BEFORE the act
 *     (the destructive-act ladder in architecture/ui-shell-settings.md), never offered as
 *     an undo afterwards: a decision on a 5 second timer is a bug generator, not a safety.
