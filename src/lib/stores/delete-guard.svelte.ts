/**
 * Who decides how hard a destructive act is to fire (the destructive-act ladder,
 * architecture/ui-shell-settings.md). One rung is in force at a time and every asking
 * surface in the app reads it from here rather than deciding for itself.
 *
 * Two ways to leave the default, and the shapes are deliberately different. A **window**
 * lowers the rung for a stretch of this session and then puts it back on its own: it is
 * runtime state, never written anywhere, so it cannot survive a reload and cannot reach
 * another device. That is the whole point. A cleanup pass is a thing you are doing right
 * now on the screen in front of you, and a lowered guard that outlives it, on hardware you
 * are not even holding, is the failure this shape exists to prevent. A **kept** rung is the
 * other choice, an ordinary setting, and it stays until it is changed back.
 *
 * Deletion is final everywhere in this app: there is no undo channel, by decision. So a
 * lowered rung is a standing condition and says so on screen through `layout/DeleteGuardBar`
 * for as long as it holds. That row can be dismissed, and dismissal is scoped to the one
 * activation that raised it (`activation` below), which is what makes it "stop telling me
 * about this window" rather than "never mention this again".
