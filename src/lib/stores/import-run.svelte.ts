/**
 * The SillyTavern folder import, held outside the page that starts it.
 *
 * An import walks a whole library and takes as long as that takes, so the reader closes
 * Settings and goes back to a chat while it runs. The run's state therefore cannot live in
 * `settings/ImportPage.svelte`: closing the panel unmounts that card, and the progress goes off
 * the screen and the summary lands nowhere while the import itself carries on writing
 * characters, chats and pictures. Held here, `layout/ImportBar` reports it for as long as it
 * runs and the page picks the summary back up on its next mount.
 *
 * Reading the pick is a step of its own (`pending`), because an import is hundreds of
 * irreversible writes and this app has no undo: the counts belong on screen while the answer
 * is still no.
 *
 * That step is also where the pick is narrowed, and the two costs are deliberately unequal.
 * **Everything is on by default, so bringing a whole profile over is still the pick and one
 * press**, with nothing to open and nothing to tick; only somebody who wants less pays for it.
 * Narrowing is subtraction and nothing else (`excluded` → `withoutKeys`), so the importer is
 * handed a smaller bundle rather than a bundle plus instructions, and there is no second place
 * where a file can be decided against.
 *
 * **A run can be stopped and there is no resuming it**, by decision. What continues a stopped
 * import is running the same folder again: every file that landed is claimed in the import
 * ledger (architecture/server-core.md), so the next scan finds only what is left. That is the
 * same mechanism that keeps a second run from duplicating a first one, and it survives a stop,
 * a reload and a server that died mid-way, none of which a stored resume position would.
 *
 * The page draws its own summary and its own failure line, so neither says anything through the
 * toast stack: whoever is looking at that card is looking straight at the thing that did the
 * work. The standing row carries the running condition, and the finish toast fires only for a
 * reader who is somewhere else.
 *
 * Runtime state, written nowhere. The run is one page's async call, so a reload ends it, and
 * anything persisted here would outlive the thing it describes.
