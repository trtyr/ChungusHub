/**
 * Transcript loads that overlap: the answer that comes back last is not the one that read
 * last, and the older one must never publish over the newer. Run with `bun test`.
 *
 * Two loads are in flight constantly in ordinary use, because a mutation awaits its own
 * refresh while the sync replay `endStream` fires runs unawaited beside it. Publishing the
 * older answer puts a deleted turn back, reverts an edit and moves the branch being read,
 * and nothing corrects it until the next refresh, so each half gets its own case here.
 *
 * Runes are compile-time macros and nothing compiles the store under bun test, so `$state`
 * and `$derived` are shimmed to identity BEFORE the store module loads, exactly as
 * new-chat-flow.test.ts does. Ordering is under test; reactivity is not.
