/**
 * Each preset's control values, plus each preset's adopted setup.
 *
 * Preset authors expose friendly widgets (toggles, sliders, selects, …) bound to macros;
 * these are the reader's chosen values for them, and they belong to the PRESET. Every chat
 * running a preset shares them, which is right: they are the reader's settings for that
 * document. What they no longer cross is the gap between two presets. Values keyed by macro
 * name alone meant two presets declaring the same name (the normal case the moment one is
 * duplicated) shared one value, so tuning a knob for the chat on preset A silently rewrote
 * the prompt of the chat on preset B, with nothing on either screen saying so.
 *
 * `appliedSetups` is the reader's other piece of state: which of a preset's setting
 * kits they adopted as their baseline, by preset id. It is stored rather than derived
 * from value-matching, because a matched-derived selection collapses the moment one
 * knob moves and leaves "reset" pointing at two different configurations at once.
