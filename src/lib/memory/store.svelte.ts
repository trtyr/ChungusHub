/**
 * Chat-memory store: the bridge between the pure engine and the running app.
 *
 * Holds the active chat's episodes reactively for the panel and the ghost rendering, and
 * drives the engine with the real RPC db + LLM. It deliberately does NOT import the chat
 * store (which imports this one); callers hand it the messages/leaf/character they have.
 *
 * The archive boundary is **derived, not stored**: `coverage` resolves the episodes
 * against whatever path the chat store last handed over, every time anything it depends on
 * changes. That is what makes the ghosts, the panel and the prompt agree by construction:
 * flipping the app-wide engine switch, swapping to a preset without {{memory}}, dragging
 * the verbatim tail or walking to another branch all move the boundary in the same tick,
 * with no write, no round trip and nothing to go stale.
