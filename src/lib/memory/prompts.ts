/**
 * Memory prompt templates + pure assembly/parse helpers.
 *
 * The templates are the user-overridable surface. The engine fills their placeholders
 * with blocks built here, so prompt *wording* stays editable while prompt *assembly*
 * stays in code.
 *
 * Memory stores exactly one kind of thing: an episode. Asking the model to also split what
 * it reads into "durable facts" and "narrative" is not a well-posed question: there is no
 * ground truth for whether a detail is a fact, so the answer swings with the model (the same
 * scene yielding 5 facts on one and 15 on another) and more than half the extraction prompt
 * goes on trying to define the boundary. "What happened in these messages" has a stable
 * answer every model converges on. That is the
 * only question asked now, and the durability the fact tier was reaching for is bought
 * instead by naming, in the templates, what must survive summarisation verbatim.

Output STRICT JSON only. No prose, no code fences.

Summarize the NEW SCENE below into ONE past-tense, third-person account of what happened: {{sceneLength}}. This summary replaces the scene itself: once written, the raw messages are dropped from the story's context and this text is all that remains of them. Write it so a reader who never saw the scene could carry the story forward from it.

Carry through, in your own prose, whatever the scene established of:
- What happened, in order, and what it cost or changed.
- Who did it, by name. Never "he", "she", "the stranger", or "the user".
- What is now true that was not before: an injury, a location, a possession, a rank, a bond formed or broken.
- What was left unresolved: a deadline, a threat, a promise, a question asked and not answered, a plan agreed to.
- Who learned or concealed what, when that asymmetry drives the story.
- How it felt between the people in it. A reader tracks the reactions as closely as the events; they are not decoration.

Reproduce names, numbers, dates, distances, sums and place names EXACTLY as the scene gave them. These are the first thing a summary loses and the first thing the story will need again.

Do not invent, infer, or resolve anything the scene left open. Do not restate the character or persona sheets, or anything the earlier memory below already says. Those are in context already. Summarize only the NEW SCENE.

{"episode":"<the account>"}

What you MUST carry over intact:
- Every person, place, faction and title named.
- Every number, date, distance and sum.
- Every thread still open at the end of the last episode: deadlines, threats, promises, plans, unanswered questions.
- Every lasting change of state: injuries not yet healed, moves not yet reversed, bonds formed or broken.
- The trajectory between the people involved, in the terms the episodes used.

What you may drop: blow-by-blow choreography, repeated beats, scene-setting detail, and anything the episodes themselves already resolved and closed.
