/**
 * Memory engine tunables.
 *
 * Defaults are tuned for roleplay turns, which are far longer than the chat-app DMs the
 * original engine was built for, so batches and the verbatim tail are counted in a
 * handful of exchanges, not dozens of one-liners.
 *
 * The tail is deliberately wider than a batch. The newest exchanges are what the model leans
 * on for voice, tone and the thread of the scene in play, and a summary standing in for them
 * is what makes a story read as though it forgot the last few minutes. A batch narrower than
 * the tail also folds in smaller steps, so an edit or a delete over a folded turn destroys
 * less and costs a shorter re-read.
 *
 * Note what was deliberately NOT a tunable for a long time: how many episodes reach the
 * prompt. Recall renders every stored episode, and the layer caps below are what bound
 * their NUMBER. A separate recall cap was a phantom lever: it hid whole batches from the
 * model while their messages were already dropped from the live history, so a band of the
 * story was neither shown nor recalled. Bounding the count happens in one place now, by
 * construction. (`recallSoftCapTokens` is the measured exception, added 2026-09-30: an
 * opt-in RENDERING budget, off by default, that folds the oldest episodes to one-line
 * indexes instead of dropping them, so the invisible-band hole cannot open. See
 * architecture/memory.md's revised note and recall.ts before touching it.)
 *
 * What nothing here bounds is the block's SIZE. Episode length is set by the templates, not
 * by these numbers, and it compounds: each merge targets about half the length of what it
 * consumed while consuming `promoteCount` episodes, and the top layer re-merges in place
 * under an unchanged cap. A saturated ladder on these defaults runs to several thousand
 * tokens, which is deliberately left to the reader's own context size rather than capped
 * here. See the recall budget note in architecture/memory.md before adding a lever for it.
