/**
 * Counted strings, per encoding.
 *
 * BPE encoding is pure: the same text under the same encoding is the same number forever, with
 * no clock, config or state behind it, so there is nothing here to invalidate. An edited message
 * is a different string, so a different key, so a miss that computes the right answer. That is
 * the whole safety argument for caching here.
 *
 * It earns its place because the live meters re-assemble the ENTIRE prompt whenever any store
 * they read changes, and most of those changes have nothing to do with the chat: one character
 * typed into a lorebook entry reassigns the lorebook store's books, which invalidates the
 * composer's assembly, which re-prices every turn the prompt would inject. Twice, since the
 * budget trim sums the whole history before deciding most of it will not fit. On a long chat
 * whose memory is behind, those turns are sent verbatim and priced on every pass, which is
 * hundreds of thousands of tokens of BPE between one keystroke and the next.
 *
 * One map per encoding rather than one keyed by encoding + text: the same text genuinely counts
 * differently under cl100k and o200k, and a shared map would hand back the wrong number with
 * nothing in the app able to notice, since a meter that is quietly wrong looks exactly like a
 * meter that is right.
 *
 * Bounded by the characters held, not by the number of entries, and dropped wholesale when it
 * overflows (the shape the prompt-debug panel's estimate cache uses). Characters because the
 * single-use callers are the ones that grow without limit: the composer's draft and the live
 * streaming estimate both count a fresh, longer string on every keystroke and every streamed
 * chunk, so an entry cap would let a session retain every prefix of every reply. Wholesale
 * because the callers that DO repeat sweep a chat's history in order, and evicting one key at a
 * time under that pattern discards exactly what the next pass asks for first. The cap sits well
 * above the live history of a very long chat, so an ordinary assembly never trips it.
