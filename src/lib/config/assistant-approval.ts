/**
 * The two approval modes as the user meets them: one table, both surfaces.
 *
 * Assistant Settings sets the DEFAULT a new tab is born with and the composer's pill moves one
 * tab on its own, so the same two choices are drawn twice. Naming and describing them here
 * keeps the two surfaces from drifting into two different accounts of the same switch.
 *
 * A mode is one line on the assistant's read < write < delete ladder (server/assistant/
 * types.ts) and nothing else, which is the whole reason a single sentence can describe one:
 * Manual reviews everything that changes anything, Auto reviews nothing.
 *
 * Auto says so in a standing badge and confirms every time it is picked. The text states what
 * is and is not reviewed and where the record of the work is: the reader is picking a working
 * style for a tool whose writes are permanent, and needs the facts to pick well, not a warning
 * about their judgement.
