/**
 * The request gates a prompt hold can sit on: the five story generations the chat fires by
 * hand. One declaration each of what the gate is called, what releasing it does and which
 * glyph it wears, so a gate reads identically in the settings card, in the review's head and
 * on the button that lets the request go.
 *
 * Background work (memory, sprites) is deliberately absent. It fires on its own schedule, so
 * holding it would build a queue of prompts nobody pressed anything to see. The Chungus
 * Assistant is out for a different reason: its turn runs server-side over a tool loop, not
 * over an assembled prompt this layer ever holds.
 *
 * Glyphs are SOURCED, not chosen: each is what its action already draws elsewhere (the
 * composer's send arrow, a turn's Retry, a turn's Continue, and the two engines' own registry
 * icons), so a row here reads the same as the control it stands in for. No two gates may share
 * a glyph: the names tell the rows apart, but the glyph is what the eye lands on first.
