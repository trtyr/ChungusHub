/**
 * Shortcuts: the app's actions reached by a key instead of by a control.
 *
 * The sibling of `registry.ts`, one list for the same reason: a binding is declared,
 * documented and matched in exactly one place. This file is the registry AND the matcher, so
 * `Workspace` asks it what a press means rather than spelling the keys a second time, and the
 * shortcuts sheet renders from it rather than a third. A key written in a keydown chain and
 * again in the sheet that documents it drifts silently in both directions at once: an
 * undocumented key, and a documented key that does nothing.
 *
 * Three rules, each load-bearing:
 *
 *  - **No shortcut implements behaviour.** Every `run` is one call into a store, exactly like
 *    a command's, so a key and the control it stands in for are the same call and not a
 *    second copy of it.
 *  - **A row without `run` is documentation.** Enter in the composer, the arrows on a turn and
 *    the layered Escape belong to whatever has focus; they are listed because the sheet is the
 *    one place a reader looks for a key, and they are matched nowhere.
 *  - **A `run` may decline**, by returning false, and the key then reaches the browser
 *    untouched. Find in chat leaves Ctrl+F alone while no chat is on screen.
 *
 * See architecture/ui-shell-settings.md, "Keyboard".
