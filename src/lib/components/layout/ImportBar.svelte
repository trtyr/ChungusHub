<script lang="ts">
	/**
	 * The standing channel's last condition (architecture/ui-shell-settings.md): a SillyTavern
	 * folder import is running.
	 *
	 * It earns a standing row for the reason the others do: it is a state, not an event. An
	 * import of a real library runs for minutes, the reader closes Settings and goes back to a
	 * chat while it does, and a readout that lived on the page it was started from would leave
	 * the app writing characters, chats and pictures behind an interface saying nothing at all.
	 *
	 * This row is the app's ONLY progress readout for that import, which is why the Import page
	 * draws none of its own: one fact stated in two places at once is the shape that teaches the
	 * eye to skip both. The page owns the summary afterwards.
	 *
	 * It also carries the only way to stop the run, for the same reason it carries the progress:
	 * the run outlives the page that started it, and work the reader cannot call off is the app
	 * taking the wheel. Stop is not on the destructive-act ladder and asks nothing: everything
	 * that landed is kept and claimed, so stopping costs nothing and running the folder again
	 * picks up what is left.
