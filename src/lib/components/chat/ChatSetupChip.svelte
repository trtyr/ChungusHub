	/**
	 * What this story is running on, and the one place to change it.
	 *
	 * A chat can claim its own persona, its own preset, its own connection and its own
	 * character version, and it can attach lorebooks of its own on top of the ones its cards
	 * already bring, or leave out one the wider setup brings it.
	 * Claiming happens here, in the chat, because a chat can only claim things it can name;
	 * the Connections page and the Library keep speaking for the app.
	 *
	 * The panel is **two levels in one place**, and that is what makes it survive a library
	 * of forty personas and a fifth claimable thing landing next year. Level 1 is a summary
	 * with exactly one row per category, so its height is a function of how many categories
	 * exist and never of how many items any of them holds. Level 2 replaces the same panel's
	 * contents with one category's list, drilled in place rather than raised as a second
	 * floating layer, since a popover growing another popover has nowhere to go inside a
	 * composer. Everything a category needs to render at either level is declared once in
	 * `categories`: a new claimable thing is one entry there and nothing else.
	 *
	 * The chip stands whenever a chat is open rather than appearing on divergence: it is a
	 * readout of the story's setup first and a control second, and a control that shows up
	 * only once something is odd is a control nobody knows exists.
