	/**
	 * The chat character's sprite, standing at the bottom-left of the screen.
	 *
	 * A bare picture and nothing else. Sprites are drawn as cut-outs on transparent
	 * backgrounds, so a surface behind one, a border around it, a name plate over its feet or
	 * the letterbox a contained image leaves are all frame the artwork was made without. It is
	 * flush with the bottom edge for the same reason: a gap under a standing figure reads as a
	 * picture of a person, and no gap reads as the person.
	 *
	 * It takes no pointer events. The sprite is the chat's own state rather than something the
	 * reader opened, so it has nothing to click and must not swallow what is under it, which on
	 * a narrow window is the composer. The portrait card (`PortraitViewer`) draws over it when
	 * the reader opens one, and that is why the two are separate components: they share this
	 * corner and nothing else, one being a bare picture and the other a card with a close
	 * button.
	 *
	 * Not drawn on phones at all: see the caller.
