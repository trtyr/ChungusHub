	/**
	 * The open chat has taken this panel's subject for itself.
	 *
	 * Raised by the panels that speak for the app about something a chat can claim, and only
	 * while the open chat has actually broken away. Without it those screens fail silently in
	 * the worst way available: the control answers, the value saves, and the story the reader
	 * is looking at goes on ignoring every word of it.
	 *
	 * The sentence lives here rather than at the three call sites, and it names BOTH sides,
	 * because either one alone leaves the reader a question: what the chat runs without what
	 * this panel says is the same puzzle from the other end. The claim itself is made in the
	 * composer's setup chip and can never be made from here, which is what keeps this a notice
	 * and not a control.
	 *
	 * Warning, not error: a chat running its own setup is a thing somebody chose, and red would
	 * read as a fault to go and fix.
