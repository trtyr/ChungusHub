	/**
	 * The star beside a setting that has left the value it would otherwise inherit, and
	 * nothing at all while it matches. The ONE way the app marks this, so an inherited value
	 * reads the same in the lorebook and in steering.
	 *
	 * **It reads the difference, not the storage.** A field typed back to the inherited value
	 * is not a change, however it is stored, and a mark insisting otherwise sends the reader
	 * hunting for a difference that isn't on screen. Callers pass the comparison, never
	 * `value !== null`.
	 *
	 * One state, no chrome: a row that follows the defaults says nothing, which is what
	 * following them looks like. The star doubles as the way back, so the value that took the
	 * detour carries its own undo instead of leaving the reader to guess at one (empty this
	 * field, pick the option named "inherit" out of that list).
	 *
	 * **Without `onRevert` it is a mark and not a control**, for the row that is itself a
	 * button: a second interactive thing inside one hit target is a mis-tap that silently
	 * changes a setting, and a row whose whole job is to open a list already carries the way
	 * back as the first item in it.
