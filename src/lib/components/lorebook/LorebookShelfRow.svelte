	 * One book on the Lorebooks shelf: the Library list row, to the geometry. Same 60x80
	 * frame, so a cover is drawn in the shape it was authored and framed in, and so the two
	 * shelves scan as one list rather than as a tall one and a short one. It holds the book
	 * glyph where there is no cover, which is most books, and the row's height is the frame's
	 * either way. With covers switched off it is the character row's compact shape instead,
	 * to the same floor, so the two shelves still scan alike.
	 *
	 * The meta line answers the two questions a shelf is scanned for: how big the book is,
	 * and whether anything carries it. It deliberately does NOT price the book in tokens:
	 * that is a BPE pass per book, so an archive would pay for every row on every keystroke,
	 * and the figure belongs on the page where one book is decided about anyway.
