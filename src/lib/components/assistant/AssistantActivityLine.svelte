	/**
	 * The activity line is the one live element of a running turn, at the bottom of it, for
	 * the whole turn. Everything above it is content; this is the only thing that moves.
	 *
	 * It answers two questions in one row. **What is happening** is the head: a family
	 * motion while a call is in flight, the cursive while the reply is arriving, the ellipsis
	 * while the model itself is working (reasoning, or a silent wait), with a phrase beside
	 * it, except while reasoning, where the block above is already titled "Thinking…" and a
	 * phrase would only say it again.
	 *
	 * **Whether anything is actually happening** is the trail: it advances one tick per burst
	 * of real activity (reply tokens, reasoning tokens, tool-call argument frames, a step
	 * landing), plus a beat of its own for as long as a call is in flight, which is progress
	 * the client can see even when no bytes are moving. What it will not do is tick while the
	 * turn is waiting on the model: that is the one state where nothing is observable, so a
	 * stalled provider shows a frozen trail rather than a spinner turning over a dead socket.
	 *
	 * The head keeps breathing while the trail is frozen, deliberately: a wait is not a
	 * failure, and a completely still row reads as a crash. Motion means alive; the trail
	 * advancing means productive. Those are different facts and the row states both.
	 *
	 * Rendering is bounded by construction, because this sits on the ~7-frames-a-second
	 * path: the trail is a fixed number of fixed-size ticks (only their opacity changes),
	 * the phrase is one clipped line that never wraps, and advances are throttled, so no
	 * amount of streaming can resize the row or move the timeline above it.
