/**
 * Lorebook activation engine.
 *
 * Three pure steps, mirroring SillyTavern's world-info pass:
 *
 *   1. scanLorebooks: read the scan sources and decide, per entry, whether it fires. Constant
 *      entries always fire; the rest fire on keyword match (primary keys + optional secondary
 *      keys combined by `selectiveLogic`, each key matched in its own mode: anywhere, whole
 *      word, word start, or a `/pattern/flags` regex). Every fired entry then passes its
 *      Trigger % roll (`probability`). An entry reads its own slice of the sources: the chat
 *      clamped to its scan depth, plus the card fields it opted into. When a book has
 *      `recursiveScanning` on, activated content joins the sources so entries can activate
 *      other entries, honouring each entry's own recursion settings ({@link resolveEntryRecursion}):
 *      whether other entries may wake it, whether its content wakes them, and whether it waits
 *      for recursion before it fires at all. Before any of that, an
 *      entry's own past can speak: `delay` holds it back until the chat is long enough, a
 *      `sticky` window keeps it in for a few generations after it fires, and the `cooldown`
 *      after that window shuts it out again. Those are read off the traces earlier turns
 *      stored, never a counter, which is what makes them branch-correct. Last, inclusion
 *      groups cut the survivors down to one entry per label.
 *   2. renderLorebookBlock: turn the fired entries (sorted by `order`) into the text block
 *      injected at the `{{lorebook}}` macro, optionally under a token budget (lowest-priority
 *      entries that don't fit are dropped). Entry titles (`comment`) are organizational and
 *      never sent to the model, matching SillyTavern semantics.
 *   3. resolveLorebooks: both of the above in one call, returning the block and the trace.
 *      Every context builder goes through it, so no surface can select differently from the
 *      one that sends.
 *
 * **Every step records why.** A scan produces one {@link LorebookEntryRecord} per entry, naming
 * the key that matched, the turn it matched in, and the reason an entry that could have fired
 * did not. That record is the whole point: an entry that silently fails to fire is the single
 * hardest thing to debug about a lorebook, and a trace is what the reply carries so the reader
 * can ask afterwards.
 *
 * Activation knobs resolve key → entry → book → global settings; a book field left at null
 * inherits the LorebookGlobalSettings the caller passes (stock defaults when omitted).
 *
 * Pure (no db / stores / Svelte) so it stays unit-testable and shared by the real prompt and
 * the live token meters. Randomness is injectable (`rng`) for the same reason.
