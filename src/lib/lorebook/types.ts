 * Characters and personas LINK to lorebooks by id (see `LibraryEntryData.lorebookIds`), a chat
 * can attach its own on top of those (`ChatFeatureState.lorebooks`) or leave one out
 * (`ChatFeatureState.mutedLorebooks`), and a book can be switched into every chat at once
 * (`Lorebook.global`). All four meet in `resolveLorebookLinks`.
 *
 * Entries use SillyTavern's native World Info field names VERBATIM (`key`, `keysecondary`,
 * `selectiveLogic`, `constant`, `disable`, `order`, `probability`, `caseSensitive`,
 * `matchWholeWords`, `scanDepth`, `triggers`, the `match*` source flags, the recursion flags, …)
 * so import/export is a passthrough, not a translation. The fields we deliberately don't surface
 * (characterFilter, automationId, vectorization, …) ride along untouched in `rest`, so a book
 * round-trips losslessly through SillyTavern either way.
