// ===== Liveness =====
//
// A socket whose other end went away without a close frame (what a sleeping host leaves
// behind, and the usual shape on a LAN) stays `OPEN` here forever: no `onclose`, so no
// reconnect, so this device silently stops receiving sync hints. Probing for silence is the
// only way to notice, and **how long that takes is the latency of the connection bar**.
//
// The two numbers behind it are not the same kind of number, which is why neither is a
// constant. How long to WAIT for an answer decides false positives, and the honest value
// spans three orders of magnitude: a round trip on this LAN is a couple of milliseconds and
// one over a bad cellular link is seconds. So it is measured rather than guessed, with the
// estimator TCP uses for the identical problem (Jacobson/Karels: a smoothed mean plus four
// deviations, which widens itself on a jittery link and tightens on a steady one). How often
// to PROBE decides how stale our knowledge is allowed to get; it rides the same measurement
// so a fast link is checked often and a slow one is left alone.
//
// Both are clamped, and the floors matter more than the estimate: a LAN round trip of 2ms
// would put the window at single-digit milliseconds, where one blocked event loop on either
// end reads as a dead server. The floor is sized against a stalled main thread, not a packet.
//
// Two things keep an aggressive window safe. **Any inbound message counts as the answer**,
// not just the pong, so a socket delivering tokens is never torn down for a reply queued
// behind them, and the probe only ever fires against a genuinely quiet socket. And **silence
// has to happen twice**, the second time with double the window, before the socket is
// declared dead. That second round is worth its couple of seconds: tearing a socket down
// rejects every in-flight request, so a single hiccup during a long wait for a model's first
