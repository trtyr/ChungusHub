/**
 * Reading a picked folder into one bundle of SillyTavern files.
 *
 * **The pick is the profile folder** (`data/default-user` in a standard install), and a known
 * folder counts only as a direct child of it. An ancestor therefore matches nothing and is
 * refused, which is the whole rule. Resolving an ancestor for the reader is not free and must
 * not come back: `<input webkitdirectory>` makes the BROWSER walk every file under the pick
 * before a line of this runs, so pointing at a SillyTavern checkout costs its entire
 * `node_modules` whatever we then do with the list.
 *
 * Everything that can be known about a pick before a single row is written, and nothing else:
 * no stores, no db, no writes, and tested as such
 * ([`sillyTavernFolderScan.test.ts`](./sillyTavernFolderScan.test.ts)). Path arithmetic answers
 * all of it but one, a persona's name, which SillyTavern keeps in `settings.json`. Staying free
 * of the store graph is what lets both the confirm card and the importer read from here.
 * Writing the bundle belongs to `sillyTavernFolderImport.ts`.
