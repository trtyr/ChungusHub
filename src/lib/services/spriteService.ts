/**
 * Sprites engine runner.
 *
 * Reads the newest assistant turn and answers with one of the character's own sprite labels,
 * which is the picture the chat then shows. Split in two like the composer transforms (a pure
 * build-prompt function, then a run function), so the exact messages a real run would send can
 * be inspected without making the call.
 *
 * How much of the story the model reads is the TEMPLATE's decision, not this module's: the
 * excerpt comes from the ordinary history macros ({{chatHistoryLast3}}, {{lastMessage}}, …)
 * resolving against the path handed in. An author who wants this cheap writes a smaller
 * number; nothing here caps it behind their back.
 *
 * No UI and no persistence here: the caller (stores/sprites.svelte.ts) owns when to ask and
 * what to do with the answer.
