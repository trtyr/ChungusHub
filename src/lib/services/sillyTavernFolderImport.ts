/**
 * SillyTavern folder importer.
 *
 * The browser hands us the whole picked folder as a flat FileList (via <input webkitdirectory>),
 * each file tagged with its `webkitRelativePath`. We sort those into SillyTavern's known
 * sub-folders and route each one through the SAME import path the app already uses for that
 * kind of asset, so there's ONE character importer, ONE lorebook importer, etc., and this
 * module only does the folder plumbing and orchestration:
 *
 *   backgrounds/       → imageService.saveImage(file, 'backgrounds')
 *   characters/        → importSillyTavernCard + characterLibraryStore.importFromSillyTavern
 *   characters/<name>/ → characterLibraryStore.addSprites, labelled from the filenames
 *   worlds/            → readLorebookFile + lorebookStore.addBook
 *   User Avatars/      → imageService.saveImage(file, 'personas') + persona from settings.json
 *   chats/<name>/      → chatStore.importSillyTavernChat, bound to the matching character
 *   settings.json      → persona names + descriptions
 *
 * The order the phases run in is the binding order, not a preference. Lorebooks land first
 * because a card names its own book (`extensions.world`) and carries a copy of it besides, and
 * a book that is already on the shelf is linked rather than shelved again. Characters land
 * next, before their sprites and their chats, both of which bind to the character their folder
 * names.
 *
 * Reading is two steps, and the split is what lets the reader point at the folder they know the
 * name of. [`sillyTavernFolderScan.ts`](./sillyTavernFolderScan.ts) resolves the pick down to
 * one data root and buckets its files, in pure path arithmetic; this module writes that bundle.
 * Nothing is written before someone has seen which root was resolved, because a wrong one is a
 * wrong library and this app has no undo.
