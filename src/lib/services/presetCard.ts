/**
 * Preset cards: a preset as a picture, the way a character travels as one.
 *
 * The file is an ordinary PNG: what you see is the preset's cover, and the preset itself
 * rides base64'd in a `chungus_preset` text chunk beside the pixels. One file to post, one
 * file to drag in, and the cover arrives with it, which is the whole reason the cover is
 * not stored in the JSON. A `.json` export is still the plain-text half of the same
 * document (`preset-io.ts` owns that shape); it simply has nowhere to keep a picture.
 *
 * The keyword is ours and deliberately not `chara`: a preset card must never be mistaken
 * for a character card by our own importer or by SillyTavern's.
