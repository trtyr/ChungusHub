/**
 * The one place a notification tone is played.
 *
 * Web Audio rather than an `<audio>` element, for a reason that is not taste: the nine
 * bundled tones span 23 dB as published and the quiet ones have to be amplified to sit with
 * the rest, which `HTMLMediaElement.volume` cannot do at all (it only attenuates, capped at
 * 1). A `GainNode` can, and the corrections live with the tones in config/sound-events.ts.
 *
 * The context and the gesture that unlocks it are shared with the soundscape
 * (services/audioContext.ts); a play that finds it still suspended says so once rather than
 * swallowing it.
