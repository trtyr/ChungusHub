 * the rest, which `HTMLMediaElement.volume` cannot do at all (it only attenuates, capped at
 * 1). A `GainNode` can, and the corrections live with the tones in config/sound-events.ts.
 *
 * Every browser refuses to make noise until the reader has interacted with the page, and a
 * refusal is silent: the context simply stays suspended and nothing is heard. So the context
 * is resumed from any gesture while sounds are on, and a play that finds it still suspended
 * says so once rather than swallowing it.
