/**
 * Composer Transform Service
 * Runs the user's composer draft through an LLM for on-demand rewrites: Spellcheck
 * (fix spelling/grammar/punctuation/flow while preserving voice) and Impersonate (expand
 * a short draft into a full message from the user's persona's perspective).
 * Both ride their own engine connection and that connection's generation settings,
 * so the two can sit on different models. Split in two on purpose (a pure build-prompt
 * function, then a run function), so the exact messages a real run would send can be
 * inspected without making the call, which is what `TransformPanel` prices its
 * before-you-press estimate off. The message SHAPE (Impersonate's role-swapped history,
 * post-processing) lives in the pure utils/composer-transforms; this file resolves the
 * live inputs it needs.
 *
 * No UI, no store writes, no persistence here: the result only ever reaches the draft
 * through `TransformPanel`'s approve/reject. The one thing this file waits on a person for
 * is the prompt hold, and that is a gate on the request rather than a surface of its own.
