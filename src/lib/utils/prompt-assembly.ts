/**
 * Pure prompt assembly: the single source of truth for turning a preset + story/chat
 * context into the messages we send AND the token breakdown every surface displays.
 *
 * Three primitives, used everywhere so values can never drift between surfaces:
 *   - buildMacroContext(input): the ONE place a MacroContext is constructed.
 *   - resolveItem(item, ctx):   the ONE place a prompt item is resolved to its messages +
 *                               token attribution (preset / context / chat).
 *   - assemblePrompt(input):    iterates the enabled items through resolveItem to produce
 *                               the final messages + aggregate breakdown.
 *
 * This module is intentionally pure (no db, no stores, no Svelte runes): the generation path
 * ({@link ./prompt-builder}) sources inputs from the db and the live token meters source them
 * reactively from stores, but both feed these same functions, so the meter always matches
 * what is actually sent, and the logic stays unit-testable.
